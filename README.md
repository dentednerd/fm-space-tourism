## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This was my first project using Next.js and modular Sass. I like that Next.js does the Sass compilation in the background, but I'm not keen on the `styles.foo` syntax for classnames.

I took this on as a practice project during my phased return to work in late summer 2023. A lot of schoolgirl mistakes were made along the way - this was my first look at code in about four months - but it's been a good confidence boost, if nothing else.

### Continued development

Quite honestly, if I never see this project again it would be too soon. Working with that Figma was a nightmare.
